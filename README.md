Task: Create your own GitHub Page from HTML and CSS

Steps on creating a github page:
1. Open github.com in your chosen browser
2. Choose the repository where the file you want to create a   page for is found
3. Go to Settings > Pages > Focus on the Build and deployment
4. Choose the branch where the html file is found
5. Click save and wait for a few minutes then reload
6. Copy/Open the link found on the top of the Pages submenu

Takeaways:
1. Routinely commit/push/merge so you have an idea of what
your progress is
2. Be consistent in the naming conventions for variables
3. Name your variables concisely, but in a way that would make
still make it easy to know what they're for
4. Create a branch/several branches where you would push the tentative versions of your program so that you could easily revert to a previous version, or make comparing versions easier
